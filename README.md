# wdl-ol-PYTHON3

This is an updated version of the wdl-ol library from https://github.com/olilarkin/wdl-ol/

I am updating this librar to meet Python 3, and may add some of my own features in the future as well.

Feel free to use this version of wdl-ol if you want to create audio plugins; however, I have just started updating it, so please note that many files are not compliant with Python 3 as of yet.
I also do not guarantee that I will finish going through and fixing this library, as I am just doing it at my need.

If I get far enough in this library, I will contact the original poster and request to update that.
If I end up adding several new features, I will just leave this repository as its own thing.

Enjoy!
